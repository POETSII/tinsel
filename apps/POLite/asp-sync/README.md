Please note that this application actually computes MSSP for
unweighted graphs rather than APSP.  So it can be used to estimate the
ASP, rather the computing it exactly.  It was used as a benchmark
application for processing large graphs with millions of vertices and
hundreds of millions of edges, where APSP is not really
tractable.
