# Tinsel

Tinsel is a highly-threaded soft-core overlay architecture designed to
run on a cluster of commodity FPGA development boards and is being
developed as part of the [POETS project](https://poets-project.org).

The current stable release is Tinsel 0.2, supporting only a single
FPGA board, and is maintained in the
[tinsel-0.2 branch](https://github.com/POETSII/tinsel/tree/tinsel-0.2).

This master branch is work-in-progress towards Tinsel 0.3, the first
version to support multiple FPGAs and floating-point arithmetic.
