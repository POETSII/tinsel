# Tinsel

Tinsel is a **manythread** machine designed for **event-triggered
computing** on an **FPGA cluster**, and is being developed as part of
the [POETS project](https://poets-project.org).  For details we
recommend that you first read the [Tinsel Architecture
Guide](doc/Architecture.md).  After that, if you're interested in
writing your own tinsel apps, move on to the [Tinsel Getting Started
Guide](doc/GettingStarted.md).
