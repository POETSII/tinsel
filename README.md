# Tinsel

Tinsel is a **many-core message-passing** machine designed for
parallel computing on an **FPGA cluster**, and is being developed as
part of the [POETS Project](https://poets-project.org).  For details
we recommend that you first read the [Tinsel Architecture
Guide](doc/Architecture.md).  After that, if you're interested in
writing your own tinsel apps, move on to the [Tinsel Getting Started
Guide](doc/GettingStarted.md).
